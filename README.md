# DSA_LeaderBoard
The DSA LeaderBoard is a dynamic performance tracker for students solving Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) problems. It automatically fetches progress data from a shared Google Sheet and displays a ranked leaderboard of the top 10 performers of the week based on the number of problems solved.
